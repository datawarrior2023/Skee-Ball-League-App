# Skee-Ball League App Development ðŸš€  
This repository tracks the full development of a Skee-Ball league management application.  
The project utilizes **AI tools and simulated team roles** to assist with the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

---

## **Business Name**  
**"AI Edge Solutions"**  
- A fictional tech solutions company that develops applications for niche markets and small businesses, like Skee-Ball leagues.

## **Project Overview**  

This application is being built to replace the manual Google Sheets tracking system for a local Skee-Ball league.  
It will streamline team management, score input, leaderboards, and match scheduling.  

The development process involves:  
1. **Requirements Gathering**  
2. **Planning and Design**  
3. **Development**  
4. **Testing**  
5. **Deployment and Feedback**  

Simulated team members will fulfill key project roles (Business Analyst, Developer, etc.), with AI-generated personas guiding each step.
