# Skee-Ball League App Development ðŸš€  
This repository tracks the full development of a Skee-Ball league management application.  
The project utilizes **AI tools and simulated team roles** to assist with the entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

---

## **Business Name**  
**"AI Edge Solutions"**  
- A fictional tech solutions company that develops applications for niche markets and small businesses, like Skee-Ball leagues.  

---

## **Project Overview**  

This application is being built to replace the manual Google Sheets tracking system for a local Skee-Ball league.  
It will streamline team management, score input, leaderboards, and match scheduling.  

The development process involves:  
1. **Requirements Gathering**  
2. **Planning and Design**  
3. **Development**  
4. **Testing**  
5. **Deployment and Feedback**  

Simulated team members will fulfill key project roles (Business Analyst, Developer, etc.), with AI-generated personas guiding each step.

## **Simulated Roles**  

### **Team Members**  
The simulated team from **AI Edge Solutions** consists of:  

1. **Emily Hart** (Business Analyst)  
2. **James Lee** (Project Manager)  
3. **Sarah Cohen** (UX/UI Designer)  
4. **Mike Ramirez** (Full Stack Developer)

## **Development Process**  

This project follows an Agile-inspired iterative workflow:  
1. Define Requirements â†’ Document user stories and features.  
2. Plan â†’ Break work into tasks and create timelines.  
3. Design â†’ UX/UI wireframes and architecture diagrams.  
4. Develop â†’ Code features incrementally, starting with the MVP.  
5. Test â†’ Test core features and track bugs.  
6. Deploy â†’ Deploy for user feedback and iterate.
