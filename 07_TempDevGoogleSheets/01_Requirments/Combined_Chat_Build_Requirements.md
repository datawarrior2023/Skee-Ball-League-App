# Skeeball League Management System - Project Progress Summary

## What Was Requested
You requested help with planning out a skeeball league management application, including:
1. Requirements documentation
2. Workflow mapping
3. Data structures/schema design
4. Function specifications and logic
5. A rollout plan

You specified that:
- The application would be built using Google Sheets as a database
- Apps Script (.gs) and HTML would be used for programming and interface
- Initial development would focus on minimum viable functionality
- You wanted modular, maintainable code with a central config approach

## What Was Delivered
We created a comprehensive planning document that includes:

1. **Application Overview & Goals**
   - Purpose and core goals
   - League context (skeeball league in arcade/bar with 2 lanes)
   - Success metrics for measuring implementation

2. **User Roles & Requirements**
   - Admin/staff functionality
   - Player needs and expectations
   - Spectator requirements

3. **Detailed Data Structure**
   - 13 database tables/sheets with complete column specifications
   - Relationships between entities
   - Data types and validation rules

4. **Workflow Mapping**
   - League setup process
   - Weekly league night process
   - Score entry workflow
   - Substitute management workflow
   - Playoff generation process

5. **Technical Architecture**
   - Google Sheets structure
   - Apps Script components and file organization
   - UI components
   - Automation points

6. **Function Logic Planning**
   - Detailed pseudocode for all major functions
   - Round management
   - Player/team management
   - Substitute handling
   - Score entry with forfeit rules
   - Ranking calculations
   - Schedule generation
   - Playoff brackets
   - UI generation

7. **Implementation Plan**
   - 5-phase rollout approach
   - Specific deliverables for each phase
   - Success criteria for each milestone

8. **Technical Implementation Notes**
   - Google Sheets setup guidance
   - Code organization best practices
   - UI implementation recommendations

9. **Testing & Deployment Strategy**
   - Unit, integration, and system testing approaches
   - Deployment process
   - Maintenance plan

## Special Considerations Addressed
- **Substitute Player Handling**: Created a system for tracking both registered and guest substitutes, with distinction between pre-arranged and impromptu subs
- **Forfeit Rules**: Implemented logic for proper match point assignment based on substitute status
- **Round Tracking**: Added both weekly round numbers (1-3) and cumulative round numbers (1-21) for better tracking
- **Top Team Restrictions**: Designed system to track the top 3 teams each week and restrict them from substituting

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Actions
1. **Create the Google Sheets Database**
   - Set up sheets with column headers as defined in the schema
   - Implement data validation (dropdowns, required fields)
   - Create named ranges for each table

2. **Implement Core Config and Utility Functions**
   - Create config.gs with system constants
   - Build utility functions for ID generation, data access, etc.
   - Implement error logging system

3. **Build Player Registration System**
   - Create player registration form (HTML)
   - Implement data storage and retrieval functions
   - Add validation and error handling

### Future Phases (As Outlined in Implementation Plan)
- Phase 2: Schedule generation and basic scoring
- Phase 3: Substitute management and advanced scoring
- Phase 4: Statistics tracking and live displays
- Phase 5: Playoffs and achievement tracking

You now have a complete blueprint that serves as both documentation and implementation guide. The document is structured to allow for modular development, where you can focus on implementing one piece at a time while ensuring all components will work together.
